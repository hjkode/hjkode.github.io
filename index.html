            <h1>Wow64, SysWoW64 and Wow6432node</h1>

            <p>
                I found understanding those concepts <i>altogether</i> is more effective for consolidating my understanding (&
                memorising) than looking at each of them separately.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>WoW64</b><br/>
                First of all, WoW64 means Windows 32-bit on Windows 64-bit. In MSDN, WOW64 also means the emulator
                which allows 32-bit applications to run on 64-bit OS.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>SysWow64</b><br/>
                A 32-bit Windows OS has one Windows system folder named <b>System32</b>. On a 64-bit Windows OS however
                there are
                two Windows system folders . <b>System32</b> for 64-bit files and <b>SysWOW64</b> for 32-bit files.
                Whenever 32-bit
                applications try to access <b>%windir%\System32</b> it is redirected to <b>%windir%\SysWOW64</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Wow6432node</b><br/>
                Similarly, to provide a separate view for a 32-bit application running a 64-bit OS, there is the
                registry key named <b>Wow6432node</b> under <b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software</b> on a 64-bit
                Windows OS. This registry key provides a view of <b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE</b> for 32-bit
                applications. (Interestingly the registry key often appears on 32-bit Windows OS. While confusing, you
                can simply ignore it.)
            </p>

            <p>
                While the default access rule says, a 32-bit application running WOW64 (the emulator) accesses the
                32-bit registry view and a 64-bit application access the 64-bit registry key, you can use the following
                flags to change the access rule when using them with Windows APIs.

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Flag name</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>KEY_WOW64_64KEY</th>
                    <th>Access a 64-bit key from either a 32-bit or 64-bit application</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>KEY_WOW64_32KEY</th>
                    <th>Access a 32-bit key from either a 32-bit or 64-bit application</th>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <h1>Building boost library for Windows</h1>

            <p>
                It is supposed to be pretty straightforward. But whenever I needed a specific set of boost libraries it
                took longer than expected. Basically there are just three
                steps for building boost library for Windows.<br/>

            <ul class="steps">
                <li>Step 1: Download a boost library zip file and unzip</li>
                <li>Step 2: Generate the boost build tool (b2.exe)</li>
                <li>Step 3: Using the build tool, build a version of boost library</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Step 1</b>
                Download boost library from <a href="http://www.boost.org/users/download/">Boost page</a>.<br/>
                While optional, it is a good practice to check the hash value of the file. For instance, use
                <b>CertUtil.exe</b> to calculate the hash value of the downloaded zip file and compare it with
                the one from the boost download page.

            <div class="code">C:\Users\hjkode\CertUtil -hashfile .\Downloads\boost_1_66_0.zip SHA256</div>

            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Step 2</b>
                Unzip it and run <b>bootstrap.bat</b> to create the build tool. This will generate <b>b2.exe</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Step 3</b>
                Run <b>b2.exe</b> with options to create correct version(s) of boost libraries. Without any
                option, running <b>b2.exe</b> will generate all variants of boost libraries with default options and
                this could take a quite long time. Below shows an example of building a 32-bit release version of boost
                libraries.

            <div class="code">
                C:\b2 toolset=msvc-14.1 -j4 --build-dir="C:\Users\hjkyod\Documents\dev\boost-build" address-model=32
                architecture=x86 --build-type=minimal stage --stagedir=stage/win32
            </div>
            <div class="explanation">
                <b>toolset:</b> Compiler version e.g.) msvc-14.1 for Visual Studio 17<br/>
                <b>-j4:</b> Number cores to run in parallel e.g.) 4<br/>
                <b>--build-dir:</b> Build directory<br/>
                <b>address-model:</b> Either 32-bit or 64-bit code generation<br/>
                <b>architecture:</b> Process architecture<br/>
                <b>--build-type</b>: Determines which build types of the libraries are created. <b>minimal</b> option
                means release builds.<br/>
                <b>stage:</b> Request output files to be copied to <b>stage</b> folder<br/>
                <b>stagedir:</b> Stage folder<br/>
            </div>
            <p>
                For the full list of options, see <a

            <h1>New chapter</h1>

            <p>
                This is a blog to share tips and knowledge gained from my side projects. I tried something similar,
                at least twice in the past but it didn't last long. It was perhaps because I was putting too much
                pressure
                on me, wanting to deliver something <i>creative and big</i>. This time, I will start small
                while trying to make this blog useful for me as well as others.
